**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

-	Overall, the goal was to utilize data structures for storing data, creating an efficient searching algorithm, and printing functions to achieve desired output results. We were told to choose a data structure we thought would be efficient for the course information input file. I chose a hash table structure.
  
**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
 	
-	Data structures are important to understand when creating a program to understand the appropriate structure to use for resources utilization, efficient data sorting / organization. Understanding a data structure will allow for code reusability. Understanding what data structure to use for the problem at hand will lead to faster and efficient programs.
**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
 	
-	Creating this code piece by piece and troubleshooting any errors while referring to class material to ensure I understood the data structure and how it functions behind the scenes helped overcome some challenges I faced when creating this program.
  
**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
 	
-	This project was presented at the perfect time for me as I was unaware, I would be creating a locally run website for a company that needed some automation, the website handled employee photos and the company manual created a table in html and added employee photos in a cell each time. I used java script, CSS, HTML, PHP to automate this process and needed to find an appropriate data structure that would properly search through over 100 images efficiently and quickly. This class helped me decide what data structure I wanted to use and how the algorithm would travers through the images.
  
**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

-	This class has helped me understand the importance of code reusability and allowed me to better understand how important code adaptability is when writing programs regardless of the size of the program it is crucial to be able to adapt and add more code while maintaining efficiency for future updates.
